=================

This package is titled a "Generic network server model" and is based on
the abstraction of a pattern I call "Server / Controller / Subprpocess".
This is a very useful pattern that consists of these components:
   a network server interface,
   a process manager to queue/schedule/run processes, and
   a set of child processes that asynchronously 
     perform long-running tasks

Add to that a command-driven interface, and a piece that can run
quick "housekeeping type" tasks without having to start a child, 
and this becomes the starting point for a lot of possibilities.

While this is based on an abstraction of a pattern, it contains 
a completely usable and functional configuration. See the 'demo'
subdirectory and the README therein for a quickstart example and
some hints for extending this package in various ways.
